# Project

dareNodeAPI, its a middleware API that conects with INSURANCE API REST to get clients and policies data, following this swagger
https://dare-nodejs-assessment.herokuapp.com/assessment-swagger/static/index.html#/clients/findPoliciesByClientId
to describe endpoints

# Features

- Node API with 3 layers design (routes with middlewares, controller, services) modular, to easy to maintein, debug, test and scale
- API with pagination and filter by query
- Node with ES6 features (uses import statements)
- Test suite with Jest + Supertes for unit, integration and end-to-end tests
- eslint custom config
- Uses pm2 for production start, forks one app instance for each core avaiable in deployment server
- Builds node version directly on depployment server
- Documented following JSdoc standard

## API design

This API is designed with a 3 layer scheme with middlewares, the goal is to delegate only one responsability to each component and have a modular app.

- Middlewares are modules to set up on each route and add a given data or functionality like authentication
- Routers handle endpoints config.
- Controllers handle routers bussines logic.
- Services are called by controllers to chek params, format data, filter data etc.

That way the project is easy to maintain, debug, and scale. Beasides you can easily unit test each component by isolation

## Pagination

/api/v1/clients and /api/v1/policies endpoints have pagination feature, default limit=10 default page=1.
You can set limit and page query strings this way,

```
https://dare-insurance-assessment.herokuapp.com/api/v1/clients?page=3&limit=50
```

Will set results to 50 and show page 3, this is the expected respose

```
{
   "total": {
       "pages": 4
   },
   "next": {
       "page": 4,
       "limit": 50
   },
      "previous": {
       "page": 2,
       "limit": 50
  },
   "results": [...results limited to 50]
}
```

## Filter by Query

/api/v1/clients endpoint has filter by query feature.
You can filter clients by name with query strings this way,

```
https://dare-insurance-assessment.herokuapp.com/api/v1/clients?name=britney
```

Will filter on clients list by name, no case sensitive, this is the expected respose

```
{
    "total": {
        "pages": 1
    },
    "results": [
        {
            "id": "id",
            "name": "Britney",
            "email": "email",
            "role": "admin",
            "policies": [
                {
                    "id": "xxx-xxx-xxx-xx",
                    "amountInsured": "$$$.$$",
                    "inceptionDate": "date"
                }
            ]
        },
        {
            "id": "id",
            "name": "Mcbride",
            "email": "email",
            "role": "admin",
            "policies": []
        },
        {
            "id": "id",
            "name": "Debra",
            "email": "email",
            "role": "admin",
            "policies": []
        }
